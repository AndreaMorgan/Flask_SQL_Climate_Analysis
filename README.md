# Flask_SQL_Climate_Analysis

Using Flask, SQL, and SQLAlchemy, this repository performs an analysis of climate in Hawaii in the effort to plan a perfect-weather vacation.

The analysis contains precipitation and station data over specific periods of time using Python, Pandas, Numpy,SQLAlchemy and Matplotlib. 

The Flask Climate app runs routes defined on /index where the user can input specific dates and have weather information returned.
